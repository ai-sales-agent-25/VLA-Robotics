**Evaluation is All You Need: Strategic Overclaiming of LLM Reasoning Capabilities Through Evaluation Design**

### 1. Summary and Rating

**Summary:**
This paper conducts a systematic investigation into the reproducibility and stability of benchmark results for popular open-source reasoning LLMs, focusing on the Deepseek-R1-Distill series and related models. The authors demonstrate that benchmark scores are highly sensitive to subtle and often-overlooked variations in evaluation configurations, such as the random seed, dataset version, instruction position, option order in multiple-choice questions, and tensor parallelism settings. They show that these factors can introduce performance fluctuations large enough to be mistaken for genuine improvements from model fine-tuning. The paper argues that this evaluation brittleness facilitates "strategic overclaiming" of model capabilities, misleads the research community, and hinders reproducible science. To address this, the authors advocate for a more rigorous evaluation paradigm built on the principles of **transparency** (full disclosure of all evaluation settings) and **stability** (reporting statistically robust performance with confidence intervals, rather than single peak scores).

**Rating: 9/10**
This is a timely and important paper that serves as a critical methodological check on the field of LLM evaluation. Its strength lies in the rigorous and comprehensive empirical analysis that systematically quantifies the impact of various "minor" factors on performance, revealing a significant reproducibility challenge. The framing of the issue as "strategic overclaiming" is pointed and effective. For a PhD-level audience, the paper provides a crucial lesson in experimental hygiene and raises awareness of the fragility of leaderboard-driven progress. The proposed solution—a paradigm shift towards transparency and statistical stability—is a constructive and necessary step for the maturity of the field. While the core ideas about evaluation brittleness may not be entirely novel in isolation, their systematic validation across today's most popular models and the clarity of the proposed path forward make this a high-impact contribution.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Evaluation Brittleness:** The paper's central finding is that the evaluation of LLM reasoning performance is extremely brittle. Subtle, non-model-related changes in the evaluation pipeline—including the choice of random seed, the specific version of a benchmark dataset (e.g., how image information is textualized), the placement of instructions, and the ordering of multiple-choice answers—can lead to statistically significant fluctuations in reported scores. These fluctuations are often larger than the claimed gains of new models, casting doubt on many reported performance improvements.

2.  **The Problem of "Strategic Overclaiming":** The authors argue that this evaluation brittleness enables developers to consciously or unconsciously "cherry-pick" evaluation settings that maximize their model's performance. This leads to the publication of peak, best-case results that are neither reproducible nor representative of the model's true, stable capabilities, ultimately misleading model users and other researchers.

3.  **A Call for a Transparent and Stable Evaluation Paradigm:** As a solution, the paper advocates for a more rigorous evaluation standard based on two principles. First is **transparency**, requiring complete disclosure of all methodological details, including inference parameters, dataset versions, and hardware. Second is **stability**, shifting the focus from single point-estimate scores to statistically grounded metrics. The authors propose using confidence intervals and a principled, iterative approach to determine the necessary number of evaluation runs (N) to achieve a desired level of statistical confidence, ensuring that reported results are reliable and comparable.
