**RLDG: Robotic Generalist Policy Distillation via Reinforcement Learning**

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces Reinforcement Learning Distilled Generalists (RLDG), a method for improving the performance of generalist robotic foundation models. The core problem RLDG addresses is that the performance of these large models, when fine-tuned for specific tasks, is highly dependent on the quality of the demonstration data, which is often sourced from human teleoperation and can be inconsistent or suboptimal. The proposed solution is to first train specialized, high-performance policies for specific tasks using reinforcement learning (RL) and then use the data generated from these expert RL policies to fine-tune the generalist foundation models.

The authors demonstrate their method on real-world, high-precision tasks like connector insertion and assembly, using two different foundation models, OpenVLA and Octo. The results show that policies fine-tuned with RL-generated data consistently and significantly outperform those fine-tuned with an equivalent amount of human demonstration data, achieving up to 40% higher success rates and demonstrating superior sample efficiency (requiring 6-10x less data). Furthermore, the resulting generalist policies exhibit better generalization to new scenarios than both the human-trained policies and the original specialized RL policies. The paper concludes that this synergistic approach—combining the optimization power of RL with the broad capabilities of foundation models—is a highly effective strategy for creating more capable and precise robotic systems.

**Rating: 9/10**

This paper is excellent. It addresses a timely and significant problem in robotics: the data bottleneck for fine-tuning large foundation models. The proposed method is simple, elegant, and highly effective, backed by comprehensive and compelling real-world experiments. The work is methodologically sound, with clear comparisons, relevant ablations (e.g., analyzing the source of performance gains from RL data), and evaluation across multiple tasks and foundation models. For a PhD-level audience, the paper's strength lies in its empirical rigor and the practical significance of its findings. It directly demonstrates a scalable path to improving state-of-the-art models on tasks where they typically struggle, pushing the field closer to deploying robust, precise manipulation capabilities. The contribution is not a new fundamental algorithm, but a powerful and well-executed demonstration of how to synergistically combine existing learning paradigms (RL and large-scale imitation learning) to achieve state-of-the-art results.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **RL-Generated Data is Superior to Human Data for Fine-Tuning:** The central thesis is that for fine-tuning robotic foundation models on precision tasks, data generated by a converged RL agent is a better source than data from human demonstrations. The paper empirically shows that RL policies produce more optimal and consistent action distributions, leading to fine-tuned generalist policies with higher success rates, better sample efficiency, and faster cycle times compared to those trained on human data.

2.  **Distillation Creates a "Best of Both Worlds" Policy:** RLDG effectively distills the knowledge from a narrow, specialized RL policy into a broad, generalist foundation model. This process creates a final policy that inherits the high performance and precision of the RL agent on its specific task while retaining the extensive prior knowledge and generalization capabilities of the foundation model. This allows the RLDG-trained policy to outperform the original RL specialist on unseen, out-of-distribution tasks.

3.  **Flexible Application to Task "Bottlenecks":** The RLDG method is flexible and can be applied strategically. As demonstrated with the FMB Assembly task, RL can be used to generate data for only the most challenging "bottleneck" portion of a task (e.g., the final insertion), while less critical parts (e.g., grasping and transport) can still use human data. This hybrid approach improves the overall success rate of a long-horizon task while minimizing the engineering effort required for RL training.
