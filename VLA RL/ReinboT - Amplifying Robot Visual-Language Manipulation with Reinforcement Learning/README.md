### ReinboT: Amplifying Robot Visual-Language Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning

**1. Summary and Rating**

This paper introduces Reinforced robot GPT (ReinboT), a novel end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model designed to improve robotic manipulation by addressing the common problem of variable quality in training data. Standard VLA models, which typically rely on imitation learning, struggle to differentiate between optimal and suboptimal trajectories within a dataset. ReinboT tackles this by integrating a core principle from offline Reinforcement Learning (RL): maximizing cumulative rewards.

The authors' primary contribution is a method to condition a GPT-style VLA model on predicted future returns. To enable this, they first propose a comprehensive "reward densification" scheme that automatically decomposes long-horizon tasks into sub-goals and calculates a dense reward signal based on four components: sub-goal achievement, overall task progress, behavior smoothness, and final task completion. This dense reward provides a nuanced measure of trajectory quality. The model is then trained using expectile regression to predict the maximum possible future return (Return-to-Go) given the current state. This predicted maximized return is fed as an additional input token to the policy decoder, guiding the model to generate actions that lead to more optimal, higher-reward outcomes.

Experiments conducted on the CALVIN mixed-quality dataset show that ReinboT achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both standard imitation learning baselines and other RL-based methods. The model also demonstrates strong few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities in real-world tasks.

**Rating: 9/10**

The paper presents a novel and well-executed synthesis of sequence modeling, VLA architectures, and offline RL principles. The approach of using a learned, dense reward signal to enable return-conditioning via expectile regression is an elegant way to leverage mixed-quality data without requiring complex and often unstable value-function learning typical of classic RL. The comprehensive reward function is thoughtfully designed, and the extensive experiments, including detailed ablations and real-world demonstrations, provide strong evidence for the method's effectiveness. The work is a significant contribution to making robotic learning more robust and data-efficient.

**2. Main Ideas**

The three main ideas of this paper are:

1.  **Integrating RL's Return-Maximization into a VLA Model:** Instead of simply mimicking all behaviors in a dataset (imitation learning), ReinboT learns to distinguish high-quality trajectories from low-quality ones. It achieves this by framing the control problem as a sequence modeling task conditioned on a maximized "Return-to-Go" (RTG) value, a concept borrowed from offline RL models like Decision Transformer. This allows the model to explicitly pursue more optimal outcomes.

2.  **Automatic Reward Densification:** A key enabler for the return-maximization framework is the design of a widely applicable, dense reward function for complex manipulation tasks. The authors propose a heuristic method to first decompose trajectories into sub-goals and then calculate a reward based on four factors: sub-goal achievement (distance to critical states), task progress (proximity to the final goal), behavior smoothness (penalizing jerky movements), and task completion. This provides a rich, step-wise learning signal that captures the nuances of what makes a trajectory "good."

3.  **Return Prediction via Expectile Regression:** ReinboT learns to predict the maximum achievable return from any given state by training a dedicated decoder head with an expectile regression loss. With the expectile parameter *m* > 0.5, the model is pushed to predict an optimistic, high-value return rather than the mean expected return. During inference, the model autoregressively predicts this maximized return and uses it to condition the action generation, effectively steering the policy towards better performance without needing an explicit reward signal from the deployment environment.
