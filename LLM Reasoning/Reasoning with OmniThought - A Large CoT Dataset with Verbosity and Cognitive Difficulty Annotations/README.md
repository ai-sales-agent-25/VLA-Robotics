Reasoning with OmniThought: A Large CoT Dataset with Verbosity and Cognitive Difficulty Annotations

**1. Summary and Rating**

This paper introduces OmniThought, a large-scale dataset comprising 2 million Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes designed to advance the development of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). The authors address the limitations of existing CoT datasets, which often lack size, diversity of teacher model generation, and detailed CoT characteristic annotations. OmniThought's CoTs are generated and validated by two powerful LRMs (DeepSeek-R1 and QwQ-32B). A key contribution is the annotation of each CoT with novel "Reasoning Verbosity" (RV) and "Cognitive Difficulty" (CD) scores. RV assesses the appropriateness of a CoT's verbosity for a given problem, while CD measures the cognitive load required for a model to understand the reasoning steps. The paper details a self-reliant pipeline for dataset curation, involving a Source Collector, CoT Generator, CoT Validator, and Score Calculator. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5 models demonstrate that training with CoTs selected based on RV and CD scores significantly improves LRM performance in reasoning tasks. The authors also release LRMs trained on OmniThought, which show enhanced reasoning capabilities and more optimal CoT generation.

**Rating: 9/10**

For a PhD-level audience, this paper presents a significant and timely contribution. The scale of the OmniThought dataset itself is a valuable resource. The introduction and operationalization of Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) scores are novel and address a nuanced aspect of CoT-based trainingâ€”optimizing CoTs not just for correctness but also for suitability to the learning model's capacity and the problem's complexity. The self-reliant pipeline for dataset creation is methodologically sound, and the comprehensive experimental validation, including ablation studies on RV/CD and application to DPO, robustly supports the utility of the proposed annotations and dataset. The work is well-motivated, clearly presented, and the resulting models demonstrate tangible improvements. The complexity involved in defining and calculating RV/CD scores, and in curating such a large dataset, is justified by the potential benefits for LRM development.

**2. Main Ideas Discussed**

1.  **OmniThought Dataset Creation and Utility:** The central idea is the development of OmniThought, a novel, large-scale (2 million entries) dataset of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes. These CoTs are generated and validated by multiple powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to address the scarcity of comprehensive and high-quality CoT data for training advanced LRMs, particularly for complex reasoning tasks.
2.  **Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD) Annotations:** A key innovation is the introduction of two novel metrics for annotating CoTs: Reasoning Verbosity (RV) and Cognitive Difficulty (CD). RV quantifies the appropriateness of a CoT's length and detail in relation to the problem's inherent difficulty, while CD assesses the cognitive complexity of the reasoning steps for a model to comprehend and learn effectively. These scores enable more tailored and efficient LRM training by allowing selection of CoTs that match model capabilities and task demands.
3.  **Self-Reliant Curation Pipeline and Improved LRM Training:** The paper proposes a systematic, "self-reliant" pipeline (Source Collector, CoT Generator, CoT Validator, Score Calculator) to curate the OmniThought dataset. Furthermore, it experimentally demonstrates that leveraging the RV and CD scores to select optimal CoTs for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and other training algorithms (like DPO) leads to LRMs with significantly enhanced reasoning abilities, better generalization, and more appropriately calibrated CoT output length and difficulty.
