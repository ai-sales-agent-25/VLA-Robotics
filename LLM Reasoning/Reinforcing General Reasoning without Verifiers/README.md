Reinforcing General Reasoning without Verifiers

1.  **Brief Summary and Rating:**

    This paper introduces VeriFree, a novel verifier-free reinforcement learning (RL) method designed to enhance the general reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Traditional R1-Zero-style RL training excels in domains like math and code where answer verification is straightforward (rule-based rewards). However, these methods struggle with general reasoning tasks where verification is difficult or requires an additional, potentially fallible and resource-intensive, LLM-based verifier. VeriFree addresses this limitation by proposing an RL objective that directly maximizes the probability of the LLM generating the reference (ground-truth) answer, conditioned on its self-generated reasoning trace. This conditional probability serves as the reward signal for the reasoning trace and as a weighting term for the supervised learning of the reference answer.

    The authors demonstrate mathematically that, under the assumption of a single correct answer format, the VeriFree objective is equivalent in expectation to the standard verifier-based objective but benefits from lower gradient variance due to Rao-Blackwellization. This leads to more stable and efficient training. Empirically, VeriFree is shown to match or even outperform verifier-based methods and existing instruct-tuned models on several challenging general reasoning benchmarks, including MMLU-Pro, GPQA, and SuperGPQA, without the computational overhead or potential issues (like reward hacking) associated with explicit verifiers. The paper also interprets VeriFree as an integrated approach to training both the policy and an implicit verifier within a single model, and as a form of variational optimization.

    **Rating: 9/10**

    For a sophisticated, PhD-level audience, this paper presents a compelling and elegant solution to a significant problem in training LLMs for general reasoning. The core idea of using the model's likelihood of the reference answer as an intrinsic reward signal is novel in this context and cleverly sidesteps the need for external or model-based verifiers. The theoretical justification, particularly the equivalence to verifier-based objectives and the Rao-Blackwellization argument for variance reduction, is sound and adds depth. The empirical validation is extensive across multiple benchmarks and model sizes, demonstrating practical efficacy. The paper is well-structured, clearly articulates its contributions, and addresses potential subtleties like tokenization. Its potential to simplify and democratize the training of general reasoning LLMs by removing reliance on verifiers, while also improving efficiency and robustness, makes it a strong contribution to the field. The insights into the method from variational and integrated training perspectives further enrich the discussion.

2.  **Main Ideas Discussed:**

    1.  **Verifier-Free Reinforcement Learning (VeriFree):** The central idea is a novel RL framework that trains LLMs for general reasoning without requiring an explicit verifier. Instead of using a binary reward from a verifier, VeriFree uses the LLM's own conditional probability of generating the correct reference answer (given its reasoning trace) as a continuous reward signal. This allows the model to be trained on general reasoning tasks where rule-based verification is infeasible.
    2.  **Theoretical Equivalence and Improved Efficiency:** The paper demonstrates that the VeriFree objective is equivalent in expectation to traditional verifier-based RL objectives (assuming a unique correct answer format). Crucially, it also shows that VeriFree's gradient estimator has lower variance due to Rao-Blackwellization (by analytically marginalizing out the answer sampling step), leading to more efficient and stable training compared to verifier-based methods that rely on sampled binary rewards.
    3.  **Extending R1-Zero-Style Training to General Domains:** VeriFree effectively extends the powerful DeepSeek-R1-Zero-style RL paradigm, previously limited to verifiable domains like math and code, to broader real-world reasoning tasks. This is achieved by replacing the explicit verifier with an implicit, self-generated reward signal, thereby reducing computational costs, eliminating reliance on a potentially flawed verifier LLM, and mitigating risks like reward hacking.
