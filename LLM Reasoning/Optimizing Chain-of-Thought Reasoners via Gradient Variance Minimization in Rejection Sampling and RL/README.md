# Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Reasoners via Gradient Variance Minimization in Rejection Sampling and RL

## 1. Summary and Rating

This paper addresses the inefficiency of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as RAFT (Reward-Ranked Fine-Tuning). These methods typically apply a uniform computational budget (e.g., number of samples per prompt) during training, failing to account for the varying difficulty and convergence behavior across different prompts. The authors identify this static sampling as a key bottleneck, leading to inefficient stochastic gradient estimation.

To tackle this, they propose GVM-RAFT (Gradient Variance Minimization RAFT), a dynamic sample allocation strategy. GVM-RAFT formalizes CoT reasoning as a latent variable problem within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. The core innovation is to dynamically allocate computational resources (samples) per prompt by monitoring prompt-specific acceptance rates (a proxy for difficulty) and stochastic gradient norms (a proxy for learning signal). This allocation is designed to minimize the variance of the stochastic gradient of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective, subject to a total computational budget. Theoretical analysis shows this strategy leads to accelerated convergence. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that GVM-RAFT achieves a 2-4x speedup and improved accuracy over vanilla RAFT. The proposed dynamic sampling strategy is also shown to be generalizable to other Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO.

**Rating: 9/10**

This paper offers a sophisticated and principled approach to a significant problem in LLM fine-tuning: sample efficiency for CoT reasoning. The framing within an EM framework is appropriate, and the core idea of minimizing gradient variance through dynamic sample allocation based on prompt difficulty and gradient norms is both theoretically sound and intuitively appealing. The provided theoretical convergence guarantees and strong empirical results (significant speedups and accuracy gains) make a compelling case for its efficacy. The generalization to other RL methods like GRPO further underscores the utility of the proposed dynamic sampling strategy. For a PhD-level audience, the work is well-motivated, technically robust, and presents a valuable contribution to optimizing LLM reasoning capabilities.

## 2. Main Ideas Discussed

1.  **Inefficiency of Static Sampling in CoT Fine-Tuning:** The paper highlights that current CoT fine-tuning methods, often based on an EM-like framework (e.g., RAFT), suffer from inefficient stochastic gradient estimation. This is primarily due to static, uniform sampling strategies (e.g., fixed best-of-n samples per prompt) that do not adapt to the varying difficulty levels and convergence behaviors of individual prompts. This leads to high variance gradients for difficult prompts (requiring many samples to get a good one) and wasted computation on easier prompts.
2.  **Gradient Variance Minimization (GVM) via Dynamic Sample Allocation:** The core proposal is GVM-RAFT, a dynamic inference budget allocation strategy. It aims to minimize the variance of the stochastic gradient estimator for the ELBO objective within the EM framework. This is achieved by adaptively assigning computational resources (number of samples) to each prompt based on two key metrics estimated during training:
    *   **Prompt Acceptance Rate:** A proxy for the difficulty of the prompt. Lower acceptance rates suggest harder prompts.
    *   **Stochastic Gradient Norms:** Indicates the informativeness of the prompt for model updates.
    The paper provides a closed-form solution for this dynamic allocation, along with theoretical guarantees for accelerated convergence.
3.  **Generalizability and Practical Implementation:** The proposed dynamic sampling strategy (GVM) is not limited to RAFT. The paper demonstrates its applicability to other RL-based fine-tuning algorithms, such as GRPO, showing similar improvements in convergence and test accuracy. The GVM-RAFT approach is implemented in a practical, online fashion, building upon RAFT++ (which incorporates importance sampling and clipping) and updating the budget allocation periodically.
