**Paper Name:** Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization: Bridging External Guidance and Internal Capabilities

**1. Summary and Rating**

This paper introduces Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO), a novel framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL). The authors argue that existing RL approaches, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), primarily bias models towards reward-maximizing trajectories based on self-generated outputs, without effectively incorporating external knowledge. This limitation constrains exploration capacity and can lead to narrower reasoning abilities compared to base models.

TAPO addresses this by augmenting the RL process with high-level external guidance in the form of "thought patterns." These patterns are abstract problem-solving strategies derived from a small set of 500 prior samples using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate solution trees, from which optimal action-traces are abstracted. These patterns are stored in a "thought library." During GRPO sampling, for each incoming question, TAPO adaptively identifies and applies relevant thought patterns from this library (based on Problem Condition Complexity, PCC) to augment the input and guide the reasoning process. This dynamic integration aims to balance model-internal exploration with external guidance exploitation.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAPO significantly outperforms baseline GRPO and other SOTA RL methods on various challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (e.g., 99% improvement on AIME, 41% on AMC over GRPO). The paper also shows TAPO's effectiveness across different model scales and architectures, strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks, and its ability to produce more explainable and readable outputs. The authors highlight that these benefits are achieved even with thought patterns abstracted from a very small seed dataset, underscoring the efficiency and potential of the approach.

**Rating: 9/10**

**Justification for Rating:**
The paper presents a novel and well-motivated extension to existing RL techniques for LLM reasoning. The core idea of constructing a "thought library" from MCTS-derived abstract strategies and adaptively integrating this external guidance into the GRPO loop using PCC is a significant contribution. The reported substantial performance improvements on challenging benchmarks, coupled with enhanced training stability (especially for weaker models) and improved output interpretability, are compelling. The methodology is sound, building upon established techniques (MCTS, GRPO) but combining them in an innovative way to address a clear limitation in current RL-based LLM training. The generalization of thought patterns from a small seed set is particularly noteworthy. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates its contributions and findings. A point could potentially be deducted for the reliance on MCTS for thought pattern generation, which might be computationally intensive, although the authors use a small seed set; however, the demonstrated benefits seem to outweigh this. The potential for broader applicability and the focus on bridging internal capabilities with external guidance makes this a strong piece of research.

**2. Main Ideas Discussed**

1.  **Limitation of Standard RL for LLM Reasoning:** Current RL methods (like GRPO) primarily optimize LLMs by biasing their output distribution towards reward-maximizing paths based on self-exploration. This approach lacks the incorporation of external, structured knowledge or high-level reasoning strategies, thereby limiting the model's exploration capacity and potentially resulting in narrower reasoning capabilities than what the base model might be capable of with appropriate guidance.
2.  **Thought-Augmented Policy Optimization (TAPO):** TAPO proposes a novel framework that enriches RL by integrating external high-level guidance. This is achieved through a "thought library" containing abstract problem-solving strategies ("thought patterns") generated from a small set of seed examples using MCTS and subsequent abstraction.
3.  **Adaptive Integration of External Guidance:** During RL training, TAPO dynamically retrieves relevant thought patterns from the library for each new problem based on Problem Condition Complexity (PCC) matching. These selected patterns then augment the input to the policy model, guiding its generation process within the GRPO framework. This establishes an optimal balance between exploiting external strategies and exploring internal model capabilities, leading to improved performance, generalization, and output quality.
