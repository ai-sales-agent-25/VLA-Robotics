**CoT-VLA: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Vision-Language-Action Models**

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces CoT-VLA, a Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that incorporates "visual chain-of-thought" (CoT) reasoning to improve performance on complex robotic manipulation tasks. Current VLA models typically map sensory inputs (vision, language) directly to motor outputs (actions), lacking explicit intermediate reasoning steps. This can limit their ability to plan over longer horizons or handle complex instructions.

To address this, CoT-VLA breaks the decision-making process into two stages. First, given the current observation and a language instruction, the model autoregressively generates a "subgoal image" depicting a future desired state. Second, it conditions on the current state, the instruction, *and* this newly generated visual subgoal to predict a short sequence of actions to achieve it. This approach allows the model to "think visually" about the task before acting. A key advantage is that the subgoal generation can be trained on both robot demonstration data and abundant action-less video data (e.g., from EPIC-KITCHENS), enhancing the model's visual reasoning capabilities.

The authors build CoT-VLA on top of a 7B parameter VILA-U foundation model and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on simulation (LIBERO) and real-world robot benchmarks (Bridge-V2, Franka-Tabletop). The results show that CoT-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art models, achieving a 17% improvement in real-world manipulation and a 6% improvement in simulation.

**Rating: 9/10**

The paper presents a novel and intuitive idea by translating the successful chain-of-thought prompting from LLMs into the visual domain for robotics. The concept of generating a subgoal image as an explicit reasoning step is a powerful one, providing both improved performance and a degree of interpretability. The experimental validation is thorough, with comparisons to strong baselines across multiple diverse benchmarks and insightful ablation studies that convincingly support the main claims. The ability to leverage action-less video data is a particularly strong contribution, as it points a way toward scaling robot learning with non-robotic data sources. The work is a significant step forward for the VLA paradigm.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** The core contribution is a new reasoning framework for robotic policies. Instead of directly predicting an action from an observation and instruction, the model first generates an intermediate representation of a future stateâ€”a subgoal image. This visual "thought" serves as an explicit planning step, allowing the model to reason about what the world should look like before determining how to get there.
2.  **Leveraging Action-less Video Data for Reasoning:** The visual CoT framework decouples visual reasoning from action generation. Since generating a future image frame from a current one does not require action labels, the model can be pretrained on large-scale, non-robotic video datasets (like EPIC-KITCHENS). This enriches the model's understanding of object dynamics and instruction grounding, a capability not available to standard VLAs that rely solely on action-annotated robot demonstrations.
3.  **Hybrid Attention for Multimodal Sequence Modeling:** The model uses a specific architecture to handle the mixed-modality data sequence. It employs causal attention for autoregressive generation of text and image tokens, which is standard for generative models. However, for predicting the final action sequence, it switches to full attention. This allows all action tokens in a "chunk" to be predicted in parallel, attending to each other and the full context, which improves performance and efficiency compared to single-step action prediction.
