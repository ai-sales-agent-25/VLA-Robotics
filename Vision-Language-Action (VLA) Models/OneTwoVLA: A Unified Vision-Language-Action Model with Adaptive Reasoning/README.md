**OneTwoVLA: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model with Adaptive Reasoning**

### 1. Brief Summary and Rating

This paper introduces OneTwoVLA, a unified vision-language-action (VLA) model designed to address the limitations of contemporary robotic control systems. The authors identify a key weakness in dual-system approaches, where a high-level reasoning model (System Two) is decoupled from a low-level action policy (System One). This separation often leads to latency issues and a lack of mutual understanding, resulting in the reasoning model generating plans that the action policy cannot execute.

OneTwoVLA tackles this by integrating both reasoning and acting into a single, end-to-end model. The model adaptively switches between two modes: it performs explicit, natural language reasoning at critical moments (e.g., completing a subtask, detecting an error, or receiving human input) and generates low-level actions at all other times, guided by the most recent reasoning output.

To train this model, the authors propose two key contributions. First, they introduce a novel data curation process that enriches standard robot demonstration data with detailed, structured reasoning annotations (scene description, plan, historical summary, and next step). Second, to enhance the model's generalization capabilities, they develop a scalable pipeline that uses large foundation models (Gemini 2.5 Pro and FLUX.1-dev) to synthesize a large dataset of embodied, reasoning-centric vision-language data.

Through extensive real-world experiments, the authors demonstrate that OneTwoVLA significantly outperforms baseline VLAs and dual-system approaches in long-horizon task planning, error detection and recovery, natural human-robot interaction, and generalizable visual grounding.

**Rating: 9/10**

This paper presents a well-motivated and elegant solution to a significant problem in robot learning. The core idea of a unified model that adaptively interleaves reasoning and acting is a compelling and logical step forward from the currently popular but flawed dual-system architectures. The technical execution is strong, particularly the design of the reasoning-enriched data format and the scalable data synthesis pipeline, which represents a valuable contribution to the community. The experimental validation is thorough, covering a wide range of challenging, long-horizon tasks that convincingly showcase the model's superior capabilities in planning, recovery, and generalization. The work is a clear and impactful contribution to the field of vision-language-action models.

### 2. Main Ideas Discussed

1.  **Unified Model with Adaptive Reasoning:** The central concept is the fusion of high-level reasoning (System Two) and low-level acting (System One) into a single, cohesive model. Unlike dual-system approaches that suffer from latency and mismatched capabilities, OneTwoVLA is a single policy that decides *when* to reason. It uses special tokens ([BOR] for "beginning of reasoning" and [BOA] for "beginning of action") to adaptively switch between generating textual reasoning at critical junctures and outputting continuous actions at other times. This allows for efficient execution while still enabling complex planning and error recovery.

2.  **Co-training with Synthesized Reasoning-Centric Data:** A major challenge for VLAs is generalizing to new tasks and objects. The paper addresses this by proposing a scalable pipeline to create high-quality, diverse training data. It leverages large foundation models to: 1) generate textual descriptions of complex tabletop scenes, 2) use a text-to-image model to synthesize corresponding images, and 3) generate relevant long-horizon task instructions and step-by-step reasoning plans for those scenes. Co-training on this synthetic data alongside real robot data is shown to dramatically improve the model's ability to ground language and generalize its planning capabilities to unseen tasks and objects.

3.  **Structured Embodied Reasoning:** The model's reasoning capability is not just an unstructured "chain-of-thought." The authors design a specific, structured format for the reasoning content that is annotated onto the robot data. This format includes four key components: a detailed scene description, a high-level plan, a concise historical summary of actions taken, and the immediate next step. This structured approach encourages the model to learn specific, useful reasoning skills like world-state understanding, task planning, and progress tracking, which are critical for long-horizon manipulation.
