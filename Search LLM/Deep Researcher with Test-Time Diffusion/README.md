**Deep Researcher with Test-Time Diffusion**

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces the Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR), a novel framework for Large Language Model (LLM)-based research agents that generates complex, long-form reports. The core innovation is to conceptualize report generation as an iterative diffusion process, drawing inspiration from the cognitive steps of human research: planning, drafting, and revision. The TTD-DR agent begins by creating a "noisy" preliminary draft, which acts as a dynamic skeleton for the research. This draft is then progressively refined—or "denoised"—through multiple cycles where a retrieval mechanism incorporates external information to enhance accuracy and completeness. This report-level refinement is synergistically combined with a "component-wise self-evolution" algorithm. This second mechanism optimizes each individual step of the agent's workflow (e.g., planning, search query generation, answer synthesis) by generating and evaluating multiple options, thereby ensuring high-quality context is generated and used throughout the process. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments on a range of benchmarks that TTD-DR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep research agents, including commercial systems.

**Rating: 9/10**

For a PhD-level audience, this paper is excellent. It presents a sophisticated and well-motivated framework that cleverly synthesizes concepts from diffusion models, cognitive science, and recent work in agentic AI. The novelty lies not in inventing a fundamental algorithm from scratch, but in the principled and synergistic combination of a draft-centric diffusion process with component-wise self-evolution, which directly addresses key weaknesses in prior research agents (e.g., loss of global context, static research plans). The experimental methodology is rigorous, featuring comprehensive ablation studies, comparisons against strong proprietary baselines, and a thoughtful evaluation framework that includes calibrating an LLM-as-a-judge against human preferences. The Pareto frontier analysis of performance versus latency is particularly insightful, demonstrating the efficiency of their proposed methods. While the work has stated limitations (e.g., focuses only on search tools), it represents a significant step forward in building more capable and coherent autonomous research agents.

### 2. Main Ideas Discussed

The three main ideas discussed in this paper are:

1.  **Report Generation as a Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Process:** The central concept is to reframe the task of writing a research report not as a linear, one-shot generation, but as an iterative refinement process analogous to diffusion models. The agent starts with a "noisy" draft based on the LLM's parametric knowledge and progressively "denoises" it by retrieving and incorporating external information. This draft-centric approach ensures the research process remains coherent and that information gathering is always guided by the global context of the evolving report.
2.  **Component-wise Self-Evolution:** To improve the quality of the information used in the diffusion process, the paper introduces a self-evolutionary algorithm applied to each component of the agentic workflow (plan generation, question generation, etc.). This mechanism generates multiple diverse outputs for a given task, uses an LLM-as-a-judge to provide fitness scores and critiques, and revises the outputs accordingly. This enhances the quality of each atomic step, leading to richer context and more effective report generation.
3.  **Synergy between Report-Level Diffusion and Component-Level Evolution:** The paper argues that the effectiveness of their TTD-DR agent stems from the tight integration of these two mechanisms. The self-evolution algorithm ensures that each piece of information gathered or plan devised is of high quality. The diffusion process then intelligently integrates these high-quality pieces into the global draft. In turn, the increasingly refined draft provides better context to guide subsequent self-evolution steps, creating a powerful, synergistic feedback loop that leads to state-of-the-art results.
