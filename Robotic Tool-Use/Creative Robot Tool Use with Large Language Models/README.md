**Paper Name:** CREATIVE ROBOT TOOL USE WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper introduces RoboTool, a system that enables robots to use tools creatively to solve long-horizon tasks that would otherwise be impossible due to physical or environmental constraints. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, and is structured into a four-module pipeline: (i) an **Analyzer** to identify key implicit and explicit constraints from a natural language description, (ii) a **Planner** to devise a high-level strategy that creatively uses objects as tools, (iii) a **Calculator** to determine the precise numerical parameters for each step in the plan, and (iv) a **Coder** to translate the final plan into executable Python code for the robot. The authors introduce a benchmark of six challenging tasks—categorized into tool selection, sequential tool use, and tool manufacturing—and demonstrate RoboTool's effectiveness on both a robotic arm and a quadrupedal robot in simulation and the real world. The results show that the modular approach significantly outperforms baselines and enables robots to exhibit creative and discriminative tool-use behaviors, such as using a hammer to pull an out-of-reach object or using a surfboard as a bridge.

**Rating: 8/10**

The paper presents a very strong contribution to the field of LLMs in robotics. The core novelty lies in structuring the problem of *creative* tool use into a divisible pipeline that can be effectively handled by an LLM in a zero-shot manner. The design of the benchmark and the thoroughness of the experiments, including real-world demonstrations and insightful ablation studies, are commendable. The error analysis, which breaks down failures into tool-use, logical, and numerical errors, effectively validates the necessity of each module in the pipeline. While the work relies on a well-established paradigm of structured prompting for LLMs and doesn't introduce a new fundamental robotic algorithm, its application and system-level engineering are excellent, clearly demonstrating a sophisticated and previously unachievable capability.

### 2. Main Ideas

The three main ideas discussed in the paper are:

1.  **A Modular LLM Pipeline for Complex Robotic Reasoning:** The central concept is the decomposition of the creative planning problem into four distinct modules: Analyzer, Planner, Calculator, and Coder. This structure guides the LLM to first reason about the critical constraints of a task (Analyzer), then devise a high-level creative plan (Planner), ground that plan with specific numbers (Calculator), and finally generate executable code (Coder). This modularity prevents the LLM from being overwhelmed by the task's complexity and significantly improves planning success by separating abstract reasoning from precise calculations.
2.  **Zero-Shot Creative Tool Use via LLMs:** The paper demonstrates that a general-purpose, pre-trained LLM can be prompted to solve complex physical puzzles without any robotics-specific training or fine-tuning. By leveraging the vast common-sense and physical knowledge embedded in the LLM, RoboTool can reason about using objects beyond their standard functions (e.g., a hammer as a hook, a surfboard as a bridge), and even plan for the assembly of new tools from available parts.
3.  **Discriminative and Constraint-Aware Planning:** RoboTool exhibits the ability to use tools discriminatively—that is, it uses them only when necessary. The `Analyzer` module first identifies whether a constraint makes the task infeasible (e.g., a gap is too wide to cross). The system then invokes a tool-use plan only if such a constraint is active. This demonstrates a more advanced, context-aware reasoning capability compared to systems that would apply a tool-use strategy in all situations.
