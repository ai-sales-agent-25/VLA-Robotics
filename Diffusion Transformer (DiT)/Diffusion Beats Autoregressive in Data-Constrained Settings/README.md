**Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings**

### 1. Summary and Rating

This paper conducts a systematic comparison between autoregressive (AR) and masked diffusion language models, specifically focusing on data-constrained training regimes where a limited dataset is used for multiple epochs. The authors find that while AR models are more compute-efficient and perform better in single-epoch or low-compute scenarios, masked diffusion models significantly outperform them when compute is abundant but data is scarce. The paper attributes the success of diffusion models in this setting to their training objective, where random masking acts as a form of implicit data augmentation, allowing the model to extract more value from repeated data without overfitting as quickly as AR models.

To formalize these findings, the authors adapt existing scaling law frameworks to model performance with repeated data. They establish new scaling laws for diffusion models, demonstrating they can benefit from hundreds of training epochs, whereas AR models show diminishing returns after only a few. A key contribution is the derivation of a closed-form power law that predicts the "critical compute point"—the training budget (in FLOPs) at which diffusion models surpass AR models for a given dataset size. This provides a practical guideline for practitioners: use AR models when compute-constrained and diffusion models when data-constrained. The findings are validated through extensive experiments and on downstream task performance.

**Rating: 9/10**

For a PhD-level audience, this paper is excellent. It addresses a critical and forward-looking problem in deep learning—the impending scarcity of high-quality training data. The experimental design is rigorous, isolating the key variable (joint distribution factorization) while keeping model architecture consistent. The application and extension of data-constrained scaling laws from Muennighoff et al. provide a strong quantitative backbone for the empirical results. The derivation of the "critical compute point" is a significant contribution, transforming a qualitative observation into a predictive tool. The paper is well-written and its conclusions are impactful, challenging the default assumption of AR supremacy and providing clear, actionable guidance for building models in a new, more common, resource-constrained setting.

### 2. Main Ideas

1.  **Diffusion Models Excel in Data-Constrained, High-Compute Regimes**: The central finding is that the relative performance of AR and diffusion models depends on the balance between data and compute. While AR models are superior in standard single-pass training, diffusion models are far more data-efficient. They can be trained for hundreds of epochs on the same data with continued improvement, whereas AR models quickly saturate and overfit. This makes diffusion a superior choice when data, not compute, is the primary bottleneck.
2.  **Random Masking as Implicit Data Augmentation**: The paper hypothesizes that the advantage of diffusion models stems from their learning mechanism. Unlike AR models, which are trained on a single, fixed left-to-right prediction task, masked diffusion models are exposed to a vast and diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks. This process acts as an implicit form of data augmentation, encouraging better generalization and enabling the model to extract a richer signal from each training example across many epochs.
3.  **A Predictive Scaling Law for the Critical Compute Point**: The paper derives a power law (`Ccrit(U) ∝ U^2.174`) that defines the crossover point where diffusion models become more performant than AR models. This "critical compute frontier" is a function of the number of unique tokens (`U`) in the dataset. This provides a quantitative, predictive framework that allows researchers and practitioners to choose the optimal modeling paradigm based on their specific data and compute constraints.
